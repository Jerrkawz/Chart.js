## Documentation

You can find documentation at [chartjs.org/docs](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/). The markdown files that build the site are available under `/docs`. Please note - in some of the json examples of configuration you might notice some liquid tags - this is just for the generating the site html, please disregard.

## Bugs, issues and contributing

Before submitting an issue or a pull request to the project, please take a moment to look over the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

For support using Chart.js, please post questions with the [`chartjs` tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chartjs).


When reporting bugs or issues, if you could include a link to a simple [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) or similar demonstrating the issue, that'd be really helpful.

## NOTE

The only change between this and the original chartjs repo is that I added an array of colors for barchart. StrokeColor and fillColor will both accept arrays of colors or a single color.
This is only for barchart.
